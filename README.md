check this out from git, then extract/rsync the directory tree to
(aka, to /mnt/usbkey/scripts/... )
... WITH THE USB-KEY mounted.

Note that /mnt/usbkey/scripts/post-install.sh gets executed at the end of
the headnode setup process.  Make sure you set your path, or use explicit
pathnames for things you'd like to setup.

Files included here:
/mnt/usbkey/scripts/post-install.sh
/mnt/usbkey/scripts/post-setup-chores/
